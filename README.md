# Distil Auto ML

Introductory text here.  Reference relevant repositories - d3m, primitives, datasets

## Quickstart

Description of shortest path to running the system with some data.  This would involve:

1.  Getting data sets - we probably need guidance from D3M program on this since they have been private to date
2.  Getting static files - d3m CLI command is `python3 -m d3m index download`
3.  Pulling the TA2 docker image from some place public
4.  Running the search command through the container using the d3m CLI
5.  Running the score command on the top ranked pipeline using the d3m CLI

## Development
### Running From Source

Instructions on setting up to run from source

- installing via requirements.txt
- running search, score using the d3m CLI

Can we make

### Building the Docker Container

Instructions on building the docker container using our build script - cpu vs gpu support
